a. Run the program. Determine the output if the loan is 29000. 
The loan with interest is RM 49300
b. Run the program. Determine the range of loan if the interest rate is 0.8.  
The loan with interest is RM 52200
c. Modify the program by using switch statement. 
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    float interest, loan, loanInterest;
    scanf("%f", &loan);
    
    if (loan >=50000)
    {
        interest = 0.5* loan;
    }
    else if (loan >= 30000)
    {
         interest = 0.6* loan;
    }else if (loan >= 10000)
    {
         interest = 0.8* loan;
    }
    else
    {
        interest =0.8* loan;
    }
    
    loanInterest =loan+interest;
    
    printf("The loan with interest is RM %.2f", loanInterest);
    
    return 0;
